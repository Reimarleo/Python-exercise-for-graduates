Please send any questions and the script to: mario.farina@kantarmedia.com

You can also publish the script to your GitHub if you have one.

## The task

The task is to write a script that reads the two files **Data file 1.csv** and **Data file 2.csv** and combines them into a new file. The result should be the same as the file **Data file full.csv**, which is only provided as an example of what the result should look like. 

Both data files are csv data files with two fields:

1.	Serial ID
2.	A variable

The output of the script should have the following fields

1.	Serial ID
2.	Variable from Data file 1
3.	Variable from Data file 2

Effectively your program will do the same as an Excel lookup, which is matching the Serial IDs in both files to add the information from Data file 2 to Data file 1.

In order to complete the task you need to know how to:

Use dictionaries

There is also a **Script.py** file with some pseudocode to get you started. 

## If you are new to programming or Python

Install the Anaconda package. I recommend 3.6.
https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows

Once the installation is complete, you can launch Spyder and start scripting! This tutorial can help.
